1) create a json file for proj1_1_materials/fp_values.txt file. The 
fp_values.txt file contains a dictionary of first-party domain and it's respective third-party 
HTTP calls.The newly created json file will contain objects of first-party
and its associated third-party values.
	
2) In the created new json file have objects with 'first_party' attribute to 
'key' of the dictionary and 'third_party' attribute to 'values' of the 
 dictionary.

3) In D3's canvas load this json file. Create nodes for all 'first_party'
attribute's values and 'third_party' attribute's values. In 'third_party'
values do not make duplicate nodes if a node with the domain is created. 

4) Using an object's 'third_party' attribute, create a link between a
first-party domain and its associated third-party domains. 

5) The D3's code will be similar to that of link given in description of 
the project(https://bl.locks.org/mbostock/950642) however with modification
needed due to the structure of the json objects.
