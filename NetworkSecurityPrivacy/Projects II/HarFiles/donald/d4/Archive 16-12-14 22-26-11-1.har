all the members of the sprawling Bush-family political dynasty, it may be <strong>Billy Bush</strong> who will be remembered as the most <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/10/billy-bush-donald-trump-video-leak\">ignominious</a> (and ultimately the most influential) of the 2016 election. But a close second within the tight-knit Bush clan may be  <strong>George P. Bush</strong>, the eldest son of former Florida governor <strong>Jeb Bush,</strong> who in August <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/jeb-bush-son-donald-trump\">endorsed</a> the man who repeatedly humiliated his own father on the national stage. Worse, it appears George P. will ultimately be alone in choosing party over family: according to the 40-year-old Texas land commissioner, no other Bushes are planning to vote for <strong>Donald Trump</strong> for president.</p><p data-reactid=\".1ggv2hfqeps.2.1.1.0.0.2.$1\">At a rally in San Marcos, Texas, on Tuesday night, Bush reportedly told a group of Republican voters that he is the only Bush voting the entire Republican ticket. Even his uncle, former president <strong>George W. Bush,</strong> may break with the party and cast his vote for <strong><a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/people/hillary-clinton#intcid=dt-hot-link\">Hillary Clinton</a>,</strong> &#x201C;potentially&#x201D; joining his father, former president <strong>George H.W. Bush</strong>, in voting for the Democrat, he said. Later, when asked by the Associated Press to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/acf02327b3114eaa977408edf5620a1a/The-Latest:-G.P.-Bush-says-relatives-may-vote-for-Clinton\">clarify his comments</a>, George P. backtracked. &#x201C;I don&apos;t know how they voted. I&#x2019;m speculating, to be honest,&#x201D; he said, adding that while they <em>could</em> have voted for Clinton, it&#x2019;s &#x201C;hard to speculate.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=\".1ggv2hfqeps.2.1.1.0.0.2.$2\">That leaves Jeb Bush&#x2019;s son as the only prominent member of the Bush family to openly support Trump. Jeb himself, whom Trump took particular glee in bullying during the Republican primary, famously labeling him &#x201C;low energy,&#x201D; has said that he cannot stomach either Trump or Clinton, and <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/gary-johnson-jeb-bush-vote\">recently suggested</a> that he may vote for third-party candidate <strong>Gary Johnson</strong>.  Matriarch <strong>Barbara Bush</strong> also said <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/barbara-bush-i-dont-know-how-women-can-vote-for-donald-trump/\">back in February</a> that she strongly disliked the eventual Republican nominee: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know how women can vote for someone who said what he said about <strong>Megyn Kelly.</strong>&#x201D; (Barbara has previously gushed, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/barbara-bush-bill-clinton-102418\">&#x201C;I love <strong>Bill Clinton</strong>&#x201D;</a>.) <strong>Marvin Bush</strong>, the mysterious third of four Bush brothers, <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/27/marvin-bush-voting-gary-johnson/\">is also voting for Johnson.</a></p><p data-reactid=\".1ggv2hfqeps.2.1.1.0.0.2.$3\">George P. Bush, meanwhile, whose mother is Mexican-American, has surrendered himself to his father&#x2019;s tormentor and a man who has repeatedly denigrated Mexicans as criminals and rapists. &#x201C;From Team Bush, it&#x2019;s a bitter pill to swallow,&#x201D; he <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/jeb-bush-son-donald-trump\">admitted</a> in August, according to video of the meeting. &#x201C;But you know what? You get back up and you help the man that won, and you make sure that we stop Hillary Clinton.&#x201D;</p><div data-reactid=\".1ggv2hfqeps.2.1.1.0.0.2.$4\"><div class=\"embed slideshow article-slideshow-embed row\" id=\"embed-gallery-54cb024f494254fc0997c22b\" data-type=\"slideshow\"><div class=\"slideshow-container embed\"><div><div class=\"embed-title\"><a href=\"/culture/photos/2013/05/bush-library-paul-goldberger\" class=\"embed-enlarge\">Full Screen</a><strong class=\"label\">Photos:</strong><div class=\"component-counter\" data-component=\"Counter\"><div class=\"counter\"><span class=\"current\">1</span><span class=\"divider\">/</span><span class=\"total\">6</span></div></div><span class=\"embed-dek\">On Not Hating the New George W.
